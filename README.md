# Inversions - school assignment

You are given a permutation P1 ... PN of numbers from the set {0, ..., N-1}. The pair of numbers Pi a Pj are an inversion if i < j while Pi > Pj. So an inversion is a disturbance in the order of a sorted ascending sequence. Your task is to determine how many inversions a given sequence contains.

The input sequence is contained in a text file cisla.in. The first line of this file contains a integer N. A permutation follows on the second line, written as N numbers from the range 0 to N-1 separated by spaces.

Write the number of inversions to standard output (in decimal representation).

N will be no more than 250,000 and the number of inversions will fit into a 32-bit integer. The input file will fit into working memory (several times over).
